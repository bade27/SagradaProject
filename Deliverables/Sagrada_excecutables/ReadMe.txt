To launch game is necessary start before "Sagrada_server.jar", possibly from cmd beacuse otherwise it starts in background and you can't see it. (Command: java -jar Sagrada_Server.jar)

After server launching you can launch client application in gui mode (with double clicking on its icon) or in cmd mode launching it on cmd console (Command: java -jar Sagrada_CLI.jar)

In next days we will fix this inconvient of starts jar on cmd console
